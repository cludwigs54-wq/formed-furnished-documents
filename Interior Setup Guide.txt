STEP 1: Prepare Your Space
Creating a well-balanced space starts with thoughtful planning. The right layout ensures that your
furniture fits perfectly and your room flows effortlessly. Our packages are designed to fit most spaces,
but not every layout will be a perfect fit right away. That’s why we provide 2–3 layout options in each
package, giving you the flexibility to customise based on your space and preferences. Use the
technical floor plans included in your package to understand the dimensions of each piece and
adjust the placement to suit your room’s flow.

Start With A Plan
You’ve already measured out the square meters of your space, now it’s time to translate that into a
working layout. Here's how to start:
•

Draw it out: If you have a printed copy of the technical floor plan (or have downloaded it),
use the scale bar (usually 1:25, 1 meter = 4 cm) to create an accurate drawing of your room.
Mark key architectural features like windows, doors, and outlets.
Cut out furniture pieces from the plan or use placeholders to test different arrangements.

•

Use masking tape: If you have an empty space, use painter’s tape or masking tape to outline
where the furniture will sit. This helps you visualise how the pieces will fit and allows you to
feel the dimensions of the room.

•

Measure out larger furniture pieces: Start with the biggest furniture pieces like the sofa or
bed to establish the room’s foundation. Once the larger pieces are marked out, build the room
around them to see how smaller accessories will fit.

•

Rearrange existing furniture: Rearranging the furniture you currently have can give you a
sense of how the new pieces will work in your space. This helps you optimise the flow and
functionality of the room.

•

Adjust and adapt: One layout might not fit perfectly, and that’s okay! You can tweak the
placement or the size of an armchair, side table, or sofa to suit your room’s flow. Combining
pieces from different layouts can enhance the overall fit.
Example: Even if you selected a layout for a smaller space, adding a larger sideboard from
the next size up might work better for your space.

•

Measure Your Windows and Ceiling Height: Accurate measurements are crucial for selecting
the correct curtain size. Measure the width and height of your windows, and note the ceiling
height to determine the appropriate curtain length. Refer to our "Curtains" section for tips on
how to measure and choose the right curtain system for your space.

3

Identify Potential Obstacles
Before finalising the layout, consider the practical details of the space:
•

Ensure doors and windows open freely: Make sure doors and windows can open without
obstruction to maintain a natural flow and ease of movement. Pay attention to rugs and
furniture with doors or drawers ensure they have enough clearance to open fully without
interference (refer to the technical drawings for guidance).

•

Check socket locations: Determine where you might need to adjust furniture placement or
plan for extension cables. If you’re adding lighting or a TV, consider whether you need to
modify socket placement or use extension cords and plastic cable covers to keep cords
organised and hidden. For permanent changes, consult an electrician.

Refer to the “Design Elements” section for more details on lighting and furniture placement.

STEP 2: Delivery Prep & Paint
Careful preparation before delivery ensures a smooth setup and minimises any issues during
installation. This step will guide you through organising delivery, preparing your space, and handling
any last-minute adjustments.

Place Your Order
Once you’ve chosen your layout, it’s time to place your order and get ready for delivery.
•

Follow the links: You’ll receive a curated shopping list with detailed information about each
product, including direct links for easy ordering.

•

Customising or swapping pieces: If you wish to customise or swap any pieces, refer to the
floor plans and layouts included in your package to ensure everything fits perfectly.

•

Furniture care: When placing your order, check if the supplier offers fabric or surface
treatments. These can help extend the life of your furniture and make it more resistant to stains
and daily use. See "Furniture Care Tips” under Design Elements for more details.

•

Curtains: In our packages, we always include a heavier curtain and a sheer curtain using the
track system to create a soft, wavy look, this works whether you have a track or rod system
already installed. Check the "Curtains" section below for guidance on how to measure and order
the right curtain system for your space, with direct links to our trusted partner Gotain for highquality, made-to-measure curtains.

Check Lead Times
Not all furniture might arrive at the same time, so it’s helpful to schedule delivery so that the largest
pieces arrive first.
•

If smaller decor items arrive before the bigger furniture pieces, store them in a safe place like a
basement or garage until installation is complete.

•

Double-check the delivery schedule and plan to have help available when the furniture arrives to
make the process easier.

Paint And Prepare For Delivery
•

Paintwork: If you plan to change wall colours, do so before the furniture is installed. Now is a
good time to order sample paint pots and test which shade works best with your space and
lighting. We suggest colours using NCS codes which is a universal colour system used by
designers and paint brands to ensure accuracy across suppliers. Each package includes a
curated range of NCS colours (shown on the Material Board in the Design Concept), carefully
selected to match your design concept and make choosing the right shade simple. See the “Wall
Colour” section under Design Elements for a full explanation.

•

Delivery Access: Ensure that the delivery firm can fit everything through the building or
elevator. For delicate flooring, cover areas where the delivery/installation team might drag items.
Use old sheets or towels to minimise damage; many delivery firms bring their own protective
materials and tools.

5

Sustainable Furniture Update
If you have existing furniture that won’t fit with your new design, consider recycling or reselling it.
This supports a circular economy and allows you to responsibly let go of old furniture.
•

Local resale platforms, donation centres, or recycling facilities are excellent options.

•

Some delivery firms also offer collection and disposal services, check in advance to see what’s
available.

Purchase List
Use this checklist to stay organised and ensure you have everything you need:
•

Light Bulbs: Check which light bulbs are included and which are not to know which types to
buy. Not all lights are dimmable. Double-check the product details before purchasing to avoid
mismatched lighting sources (refer to the “Lighting” section under Design Elements).

•

Self-Adhesive Bumpers and Felt Stickers: For walls or furniture to prevent damage and
protect surfaces.

•

Curtain Accessories: Verify your existing curtain system (refer to the “Curtains” section
under Design Elements). We have provided detailed information on where, what, and how to
purchase the right accessories.

•

Nails, Bolts, or Self-Adhesive Hooks: For hanging artwork. Check the “Decoration” section
under Design Elements for further guidance on what to choose and how to hang it the best
way.

6

STEP 3: Installation & Setup
A smooth installation starts with the right preparation and attention to detail. This step will guide you
through setting up your furniture and decor while maintaining balance and flow in your space.

Gather Your Tools
Having the right tools on hand will make the setup process easier and more efficient.
•

Basic tools: Prepare a tape measure, level, screwdriver, and any other tools mentioned in
your furniture instructions. Some furniture may come with the necessary tools and screws, so
check the packaging before starting.

•

For professional installation: If you’ve ordered an installation service, provide them with the
technical drawings or the floor plan you’ve created. Clearly communicate which wall or
placement the furniture should have in your space.

Tip: If you can, supervise the installation process to get the exact result you want. Don’t hesitate to
ask the team to adjust the position of furniture, remember, this is your space!

Follow The Sequence
Setting up in the right order helps maintain balance and flow.
•

Start with larger items: Begin with key furniture pieces like the sofa or bed to set the room's
foundation.

•

Add smaller decor pieces: Once the larger pieces are in place, add smaller decor like side
tables, lamps, and artwork.

•

Be patient: Not all pieces may arrive at the same time, so don't worry if it feels incomplete at
first, it will come together in the end.

Set Up Your Lighting
Once the main furniture pieces are in place, it’s time to set up the lighting to enhance the mood and
functionality of the room.
•

Follow the plan: Refer to the floor plan to place table lamps, floor lamps, and ceiling lights
as suggested in your package. This ensures that lighting is positioned to balance the overall
feel of the room.

•

Adapt if needed: If you realise you need more or less lighting once you’ve lived in the space,
you can always adjust the positioning or add extra light sources.

Install Your Curtains
Once your measurements and curtain selections are ready, hang your curtains according to the layout
and system in place. Refer to our “Curtains” section for tips, and visit Gotain’s installation guide for
detailed instructions and accessory recommendations.

Attention To Detail
The smallest adjustments can make a big difference in how a space feels.
•

Align and center artwork: Hang artwork at eye level and ensure it's centered with
surrounding furniture. For more detailed guidance on how to hang wall art and decor, refer to
the "Decoration" section below.

•

Symmetry matters: Pay attention to symmetry when arranging decor and furniture to create a
balanced and harmonious feel.

Step Back And Reassess
Once everything is installed, take a moment to evaluate how the space feels.
•

Test the flow: Walk through the room to see if the layout feels natural and functional.

•

Make changes if needed: If something doesn’t feel right, adjust it! Keep the original
packaging and track the return policy in case you decide to swap out any items.

8

STEP 4: Finishing Touches
The final details bring warmth and personality to your space. This step will guide you through adding
texture, personal elements, and final adjustments to create a cohesive and inviting atmosphere.

Layering And Textures
Layering decorative elements adds depth and warmth, helping to make your space feel cohesive and
inviting.
•

Place soft elements: Use the selected throws, cushions, and rugs from your package to add
softness and comfort to the room.

•

Install curtains: Once your furniture is in place, installing curtains will complete the look of
your space. Gotain’s simple rail and hook system allows for easy installation and adds a
luxurious touch to your windows and your space.

•

Arrange decorative accents: Position the recommended candles, vases, and photo frames to
complete the design.

Personal Touches
Adding personal elements makes your space feel more authentic and lived-in.
•

Use sentimental items: Incorporate photos, heirlooms, or travel souvenirs to make the space
reflect your personality.

•

Balance personal pieces with the overall design: Keep the colour palette and style
consistent to maintain harmony.

Bring In The Greenery
Plants add a refreshing and organic feel to any room.
•

Add plants strategically: Place taller plants in corners and smaller plants on shelves or
tables.

•

Wait until the furniture is in place: This helps you see where plants would work best based
on the available space and lighting.

•

Low maintenance options: See the "Plants & Flowers" section for suggestions on easy-care
plants that are perfect for indoor settings.

After Setup
Once everything is in place, give yourself time to adjust and refine.
•

Live with it: Allow yourself time to get used to the new layout — small adjustments may be
needed to find the perfect balance.

•

Add or adjust pieces: If you feel something is missing, go back to the concept and shopping
list to add final touches.

•

Maintain your space: Regular cleaning and maintenance will help preserve the look and feel
of your newly designed room.

Tip: New furniture, rugs, and textiles may carry a temporary smell, shed, or appear creased at first.
This is normal and will ease with time. Air out the space and gently clean or wash fabrics according
to care instructions to help everything settle beautifully.

DESIGN ELEMENTS
In this section we go more in depth of each element that make up your space. Its a good section to
refer to before the process but also afterwards to optimise your space.

Lighting
Lighting plays a crucial role in setting the right mood and atmosphere in any space. Properly
designed lighting can enhance the functionality and aesthetic appeal of your home. Here’s a guide on
how to effectively use lighting, including standards for hanging pendant lights to ensure a welldesigned and functional space. By following these guidelines below, you can create a beautifully lit
space that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

Creating The Right Mood With Lighting
To create a well-lit and inviting space, it’s essential to use a balanced combination of different light
sources. Here’s how to structure your lighting:
•

Ambient Lighting: This is the base lighting in the room, often provided by ceiling lights, wall
lights, or large floor lamps. It ensures overall brightness and sets the tone for the room.

•

Task Lighting: This lighting is functional and focused. Use it in areas where you need more
light, such as reading corners, kitchen worktops, or home office desks. Desk lamps or undercabinet lights are common task lights.

•

Accent Lighting: This adds depth and highlights certain features, like artwork, shelving, or
architectural details. Spotlights or smaller decorative lamps work well here.

Matching Lighting In Larger Spaces
In open-plan or multi-functional rooms, maintaining a consistent lighting tone is essential. Using
different bulb types or colour temperatures in the same space can create visual disharmony or make
the room feel disconnected. Stick to one Kelvin range (e.g., 2700K–3000K for warm light) across all
light sources in the same zone to ensure a cohesive atmosphere.

Tip: Double-check your bulb selections if you're mixing pendants, floor lamps, and task lighting in the
same area.

Hanging Pendant Lights
When hanging pendant lights, consider both the aesthetics and functionality to ensure they
complement the space without obstructing views or interfering with other elements.
•

Above Dining Tables: Hang pendant lights 50–60 cm above the table to provide enough light
without obstructing views.

•

In Living Rooms: Ensure pendant lights are not too low; they should not block the view of the
TV or other focal points.

•

Adjustability: Some pendant lights can be adjusted in length. Before installation, test the
height and adjust as needed.

Lightbulbs
When buying a lightbulb, you’ll see several numbers and terms on the package. Here’s a simple guide
to what they mean, helping you choose the right lightbulb for your interiors.

Key Elements On A Lightbulb Package
1. Wattage (W): Indicates power consumption. Lower wattage = lower energy use and cost.
2. Lumens (lm): Measures brightness. Higher lumens = brighter light.
3. Lifespan (hours): How long the bulb lasts before needing replacement.
4. Base Type: Ensure the bulb fits your fixture (e.g., E27, GU10).
5. Kelvin (K): Defines the colour temperature:

Daylight - Bright and crisp light, great for
r e a d i n g , w o r k s p a c e s a n d c a s u a l c l a r i t y.

6. Bulb Type (LED vs. Halogen): We recommend LEDs, they’re energy-efficient, long-lasting, often
dimmable, and available in a wide range of tones. Halogen bulbs, by contrast, consume more energy,
generate more heat, have a shorter lifespan, and are gradually being phased out due to
environmental and efficiency standards.
7. Dimmability: Not all bulbs work with dimmer switches. Check if both your bulb and fixture are
marked “dimmable” to avoid flickering or incompatibility.

Lightbulb Checklist – What To Double Check Before You Buy
1. Wattage - Does it match what your fixture allows?
2. Lumens - How bright do you want the room to be?
3. Kelvin - What kind of ambiance are you going for? (See Kelvin chart)
4. Base Type - Does it fit your lamp (e.g., E27, GU10)?
5. Dimmable or Not? - If you have a dimmer switch, make sure your bulb is compatible!

Curtains
Curtains enhance both the look and function of your home, adding softness, privacy, and control over
light and temperature. In your design package, we’ve already selected curtain combinations that
balance style and practicality for each room. Our trusted partner Gotain offers high-quality, made-tomeasure solutions to complete your space. All that’s left is to measure, match your system, place your
order, and install.

Measuring Your Curtains
Accurate measurements are crucial for achieving the perfect fit. Gotain provides a straightforward
guide to help you measure your windows effectively, ensuring that the curtains you’ve selected will
look stunning and function properly. Learn more visit Gotain - How to Measure

Types Of Curtain Systems
•

Curtain Rods Traditional rods where curtains can be drawn manually.
Best For: Simple installations, lightweight curtains, and standard windows.

•

Track Rails Allows curtains to glide smoothly and can handle heavier curtains.
Best For: Heavy drapes, curved windows, and creating layered curtain solutions.

•

Roman Blinds Fixed directly onto or over the window frame, blinds offer precise control over
light and privacy.
Best For: Modern, minimalist aesthetics, and spaces requiring enhanced light control.

Curtains For Each Room
Your design package already includes a thoughtfully curated curtain combination, chosen to balance
both aesthetic appeal and practical function. Below is a quick overview of how these curtains
enhance each room.
•

Living Room: Layered curtains with light-filtering sheers and heavier drapes. Sheers allow
natural light during the day, while heavier drapes act as a decorative item, providing privacy
and insulation at night in case you do not have any shutters.

•

Bedroom: Blackout curtains combined with light-filtering blinds/curtains. Blackout curtains
ensure darkness for better sleep, while light blinds/curtains can adjust the light levels during
the day.

•

Dining/Kitchen: In dining areas, layered linen curtains with light-filtering sheers create a
cohesive and elegant atmosphere, especially in open-plan layouts. In kitchens, Roman blinds
or café curtains are a practical solution, offering privacy while still allowing in natural light.

•

Guest/Office-Room: Light-filtering curtains with adjustable blinds. This helps control glare on
screens while maintaining a professional and comfortable environment.

Installing Your Curtains
Hanging curtains might seem tricky, but with the right tools and a little guidance, it’s simple and
satisfying.Here’s a quick overview to get started:
1. Mark your placement: Measure and mark where your curtain rail or rod should go — ideally close
to the ceiling to create height and drama.
2. Install your hardware: Drill your brackets or track into place, using a level to ensure everything is
straight. Gotain’s curtains can be hung on both rods and tracks depending on your setup.
3. Add hooks or gliders: Depending on your system, use the recommended hooks or gliders (we’ve
linked to the correct ones in your shopping list).
4. Hang your curtains: Once your hardware is secure, hang the curtains and adjust the folds to
create a full, wavy look.

Wall Colour
Wall colour has a powerful influence on both the look and feel of a room. It’s an effective way to
complement your overall design concept whether you’re aiming for something calm and neutral or
want to add a pop of personality. Your design package includes a curated range of colour options to
suit either direction.

Colour Codes (NCS)
All our Wall Colour selections are based on the NCS (Natural Colour System) which is a globally
recognised colour standard used by interior designers, architects, and painters. It helps you
accurately compare, match, and combine tones, regardless of the paint brand. Each NCS colour code
reflects how we visually perceive colour, allowing you to test and select paint with confidence. You'll
find these codes on the Material Board included in your Design Concept.

Lighting Impacts Colour Perception
Before choosing your paint, keep in mind that lighting can dramatically affect how colour appears in a
space. Here's how:
•

Natural Light: South-facing rooms tend to make colours appear warmer and brighter. Northfacing rooms might cool down tones, making them feel moodier or more muted.

•

Artificial Light: Warm light (2700K–3000K) enhances earthy tones like beige, terracotta, or
soft pinks. Cool white light (3500K–4100K) works well with greys, whites, and blues.

Our Colour Concept In Your Package
Each design package includes a thoughtfully curated colour palette to complement your layout,
lighting, and furniture. Each tone is chosen to offer flexibility while ensuring harmony and flow
throughout the room whether you lean towards calm neutrals or want to explore a more expressive
statement.
•

Light Neutrals: A selection of warm and cool-toned light shades that work beautifully across
all walls. These options are designed to complement both your new furnishings and any
existing elements like built-ins or kitchens, helping you create a soft, cohesive base with an
elevated feel.

•

Darker Tones & Accents: To add contrast or a touch of personality, each package includes
deeper colours, typically a muted dark neutral and, depending on the style, a bolder accent.
These can be used to create cozy feature walls or layered with lighter tones for depth and
dimension.

Try Before You Commit
We always recommend testing paint in your space before finalising:
•

Order sample pots and paint directly on the wall or on white A4/A3 paper.

•

Move the sample around your space and observe it at different times of day, in both natural
and artificial light.

•

Colours will shift with the season, weather, and light exposure especially in rooms with angled
ceilings or limited sunlight.

Need Support?: If you're unsure which colour to go for, don’t hesitate to reach out. You can always
book your complimentary 30-minute consultation to discuss colour combinations, placement, or how
to adjust based on your home’s lighting conditions.

16

Decoration
Decorating goes beyond hanging wall art, it’s the finishing layer that brings personality, warmth, and
depth to your home. It’s what makes a space feel truly yours. From styled shelves to soft accessories,
the thoughtful placement of decor helps you tell your story and bring the full design concept to life.
Our packages include handpicked decor suggestions to simplify this process and ensure harmony
with your overall interior.

Style With Your Decor
Our design packages include a selection of decor items that are intentionally chosen to suit your
layout, colour palette, and lighting.
•

Create visual balance: Distribute decor evenly across the room not everything should sit on
one side. Use symmetry or asymmetry depending on your space and style.

•

Group by threes: Vary height, texture, or material in sets of 3. This works great on
sideboards, coffee tables, or shelves.

•

Leave breathing room: Don’t overcrowd. Negative space allows each item to stand out and
gives a cleaner, elevated look.

•

Mix materials: Pair ceramics with glass, books with candles, or metallics with soft textures
like linen or velvet.

•

Make it personal: Add meaning with objects you already own, family photos, books,
souvenirs, or heirlooms. The key is blending your story with the curated look of the design.

Seasonal Decor Advice
Switching up small items seasonally can help refresh the space without a full redesign.
•

Spring/Summer: Use lighter fabrics, fresh greenery, and pale ceramics

•

Autumn/Winter: Layer in warm-toned throws, candles, and natural wood elements

Avoid holiday-specific decor in permanent styling instead, think in textures, colours, and seasonal
mood.

round, visit our blog for ongoing inspiration and easy how-to’s.

How To Hang Wall Decor & TVs
Wall decor adds depth and personality to your space but getting it right takes more than just placing
a nail in the wall. Whether you're hanging artwork, a gallery wall, mirrors, or a TV, the key is planning,
precision, and using the right tools.

Before You Start
•

Check your walls: Make sure the surface is free of electrical wires or pipes. Your wall type
(plaster, drywall, or concrete) will determine the fixings you need.

•

If you’re renting: Ask your landlord for approval before drilling. Consider how you’ll patch
holes when you move out.

•

When in doubt: Consult a professional for guidance on tools or wall anchors for heavier
pieces.

Tip: Always double-check for hidden hazards, especially in older walls or unfamiliar buildings.

Step-By-Step Guide
1. Gather Your Tools: Tape measure, pencil, level, hammer or drill, nails or screws, wall plugs,
picture hooks, and a stud finder for heavier items.
2. Plan Your Layout: Lay your pieces out on the floor to test spacing, arrangement, and flow. Use
symmetry or asymmetry depending on your style and the room’s focal point.
For gallery walls, start from the center and work outward, leaving 5–10 cm between frames for
breathing room.
3. Measure & Mark
•

Artwork: Center should sit approx. 145–150 cm from the floor for comfortable eye level.

•

Above Furniture: Leave 10–15 cm between the top of the furniture and the bottom of the
decor.

•

TVs: Center should sit approx. 105–120 cm from the floor when seated.
◦

Example: 50” TV → center ≈ 115–125 cm from the floor
Console 76 cm high → bottom of TV ≈ 86–91 cm from the floor

•

Mark all placements with a pencil before drilling.

4. Mount with Stability
•

Light items: Use picture hooks or nails.

•

Heavy items (TVs, mirrors, large frames): Always use wall anchors or screws into studs. Use
multiple hooks to evenly distribute weight if needed.

•

Follow the manufacturer's instructions when included.

5. Final Adjustments
Use a level to ensure everything is perfectly aligned before securing items in place. Step back and
adjust spacing if necessary.
Tip: For a polished finish, use cable covers, zip-ties, or hide cords inside the wall — especially when
mounting a TV.

18

Furniture Care Tips
When it comes to caring for your furniture, as we mention in Step 2, we recommend checking with
each supplier to see if care kits or protective treatments are available. Some items may already come
with a protective layer, but it’s worth confirming. These treatments can help preserve the finish and
extend the life of your pieces.
•

Upholstered Items & Textiles: Fabric protection sprays can be applied before use to reduce
damage from spills, stains, or colour transfer (like jeans rubbing off). These treatments form a
barrier that makes cleaning easier and helps maintain appearance over time.

•

Wood, Marble, or Composite Surfaces: Always use coasters under glasses to avoid ring
marks or staining. For cleaning, follow the supplier’s guidance to avoid damaging the surface.

•

Rugs & Textiles: Light shedding or a mild odour is normal at first especially for wool rugs,
which can take time to settle. However, if there’s a persistent smell of mould, contact the
supplier immediately as it may have been damaged during packaging.

•

Sun Exposure: Direct sunlight can weaken materials or fade colours. If your furniture or
décor is placed near a bright window, consider adding a sheer curtain to help protect the
items over time.

Always refer to the specific care label for maintenance instructions.

19

Plants & Flowers
Whether you opt for a large statement plant or a few delicate branches, greenery brings softness,
structure, and soul to any space. Incorporating greenery can elevate your interior design, support
well-being, and create a more harmonious space. This section will guide you on how to integrate
plants and flowers into your space in a way that feels intentional, low-maintenance, and visually
balanced.

Why Add Plants To Your Home?
•

Visual Balance & Softness: Plants naturally break up hard lines from furniture and
architecture, adding flow and movement to a room. Whether it's a leafy floor plant or a
sculptural stem in a vase, greenery creates visual contrast and brings a sense of calm.

•

Elevated Styling: Adding greenery is one of the most effective ways to make a home feel
“finished.” A tall plant in the corner, branches on a console, or a small floral arrangement on a
shelf adds depth, dimension, and a designer feel, without effort.

•

Biophilic Benefits: Even a small touch of nature can promote relaxation and reduce stress.
By integrating natural elements into your home, you create an environment that feels
grounding and more connected to the outdoors.

•

Sustainable Decorating: Dried or low-maintenance plants like grasses or preserved branches
are long-lasting, stylish, and eco-friendly. They offer the benefits of greenery with little to no
upkeep, making them ideal for modern living.

Choosing The Right Plants For Your Home
When selecting greenery, consider your lifestyle, your space, and how much maintenance you're
comfortable with. Plants are more than just decorative, they shape the mood, style, and well-being of
your home.

Aesthetic Role of Greenery: The plants you choose can reinforce your interior’s overall tone.
•

Dark, sculptural leaves like rubber or fiddle leaf figs suit modern or neutral settings.

•

Light, airy grasses bring a soft, coastal feel to minimalist spaces.

•

Delicate florals and blush tones soften shelves or table tops.

•

Cactus or palm-style plants introduce a grounded, bohemian vibe.

Easy-Care Plants: Choose plants that align with your routine. If you're new to plant care or often
away, opt for hardy varieties:
•

Pampas grass or dried branches add height and texture without the need for water.

•

Cactus and succulents thrive in sunny spots and require minimal upkeep.

•

Monstera or fig trees are great for indirect light and bring bold greenery with little effort.

20

Practical Placement & Care: Smart placement and simple routines help your plants stay healthy and
look their best.
•

Group plants by height for layered visual interest.

•

Place near soft, indirect light and avoid radiators or cold drafts.

•

Rotate plants every few weeks for even growth, and gently wipe leaves to keep them looking
fresh.

•

Always check light and water needs to make sure your plants thrive long-term.

Pet- & Child-Safe Homes: Some plants (like lilies or certain ferns) can be toxic to pets or small
children, always double-check before purchasing.

Fresh Flowers
Fresh flowers bring charm, fragrance, and a sense of occasion to your home. They’re perfect for
seasonal decoration, gifting moments, or simply adding life to everyday corners. While plants are our
go-to for longevity, there are smart ways to enjoy flowers without the need to replace them weekly.
To make fresh florals more sustainable and cost-effective, choose varieties that can be reused, dried,
or even replanted. Here are a few great options:

Potted Flowers As Longer-Lasting Alternative
If you love the look of fresh flowers but want a more cost-effective, longer-lasting option, potted
flowering plants like orchids or craspedia (the cheerful yellow “billy ball” flowers) are a beautiful
solution. While they can require a bit more care, they bring elegance and color to your home without
the need for weekly replacements. If you enjoy tending to plants, they’re a rewarding and decorative
way to keep your space feeling fresh year-round.
