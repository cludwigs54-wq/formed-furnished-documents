Before Setup – Planning & Preparation

Pre-Installation - Prepare Items
Curtain Accessories: Verify your existing curtain system (refer to the “Curtains” section in the Interior Setup
Guide). Order rails, hooks, or accessories accordingly.

Setup Guide for recommended types and purchase them before installation.
Read Manuals: Check the product packaging & condition and note down any required tools or installation
steps.

Have a toolkit handy: Measuring tape, screwdriver, level, etc. Or arrange with a handyman.
Inspect Packaging: Check the packaging & condition of delivered items before assembling.
Apply Protection: Keep felt stickers or self-adhesive bumpers to prevent floor/wall damage.

furniture & lighting manuals.

Refine Layout: Adjust layout as needed for balance & flow, see and feel what is right for you.

for correct height and clean cable placement.

Final Touches – Styling & Decor
